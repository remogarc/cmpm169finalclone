					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Hello! My is Stephanie Ramirez (She/Her). 
						I am currently in my fourth year of studying Computer Science: Game Design as UC Santa Cruz. 
						My profound interest in programming has been with me since a young age, 
						and I made the decision to merge my two passions into a single major. 
						My goal is to craft experiences that resonate emotionally with individuals through various forms of media, 
						be it through art or video games. </p>
